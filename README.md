## An Elementary Data Analysis on the MLB 2012 Season and the Impact Each Team's PAYROLL has on WINS
Kabir Snell 11/16/2021-TBD

## Overview and Hypothesis
In this analysis we will take use the payroll data and wins data of each team that competed in the MLB 2012 season to see if there is a connection between how much money teams spend and the success that they have. It is expected that the more money a team spends, they will have more success on average. This project will be done in Jupyter Notebook and the data can be found given as a csv file in this repository. This is my first project that I will be placing on GitHub with hopefully many more and better projects to come.
A full report can be found at the google doc link below.

Full analysis is in progress, under the file name "Full Analysis and Report"
